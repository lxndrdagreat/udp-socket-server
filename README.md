# udp-socket-server
A messy, threaded UDP socket server written in Python

## Echo Example

There is an included example that is just an echo server.

Start the server by running `example_echo_server.py`.

Then start as many copies of `example_echo_client.py` as you want.

## Game Example

There is a simple "game" (term used loosely) server example.

Run it via `example_game_server.py`.
